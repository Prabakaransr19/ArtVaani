- Accent color: Mustard yellow (#FFDB58) to highlight key interactive elements and calls to action, providing contrast and vibrancy.
- Body text and Headlines: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, with a handwritten style option for a more personal touch.
- Use hand-drawn style icons to reflect the handmade nature of the crafts.
- Story-first experience emphasizing artisan stories before product catalogs. Design should feel artistic and less structured.
